Hello and welcome to my corner of the interwebs.

<h3>Theatre</h3>

When i was in 5th grade i was cast as the lead in the school play. I was awful and miserable, i couldn't learn my lines, i had to sing even though i cant, and i lost my voice i was miserable, and i loved it. Quickly i realized that i loved telling stories through theatre but i wasn't going to be able to do that as a character on stage, instead i settled into backstage roles, working on every show i could durring middle school and high school. After high school i went off to college, planing to study Engineering and thinking that my theatre days were long behind me... famous last words.
